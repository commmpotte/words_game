# Word Game

This project is a simple Hangman game implemented with React using JSX and TypeScript.

## Overview

Hangman is a word-guessing game where the player attempts to guess a hidden word letter by letter. For each incorrect guess, a part of a "hangman" is drawn. The game ends either when the player correctly guesses the word or when the hangman is fully drawn.

## Features

- React: The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: TypeScript is used to add static typing to JavaScript, providing improved developer tooling and code quality.
- JSX: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended by React for describing what the UI should look like.

## How to Play

1. The game starts with a randomly selected word.
2. The player guesses letters by pressing keys on the keyboard.
3. Correctly guessed letters are revealed in the word.
4. Incorrectly guessed letters contribute to drawing the hangman.
5. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the word or when the hangman is fully drawn.
